## Submission of Global Lmic Reports via Orderly To DIDE

This is a working R package for submitting global fits to DIDE cluster. 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/mrc-ide/glodide.git
cd glodide
open glodide.Rproj
devtools::install_deps()
```

## Overview

The structure within analysis is as follows:

```
analysis/
    |
    ├── 01_submission /       # submission scripts 
    |
    ├── data/
    │   ├── DO-NOT-EDIT-ANY-FILES-IN-HERE-BY-HAND
    │   ├── raw_data/       # orderly bundles provided from bundling in global-lmic-reports-orderly
    │   └── derived_data/   # orderly outputs produced from running reports in raw_data
```

## Process for submitting Jobs

This repository is used for submitting orderly reports to the DIDE cluster. Outline of steps:

> Run in `global-lmic-reports-orderly` 

1. Execute bundle script in `global-lmic-reports-orderly` repository to produce orderly bundles in `analysis/data/raw_data` in `glodide`

> Run in `glodide` 

2. Submit bundles to the DIDE HPC cluster using `analysis/01_submission.R` that  uses `d

> Run in `global-lmic-reports-orderly` 

3. Check fits are correct using code in `global-lmic-reports-orderly` and resubmit any countries that need to be rerun/run for longer
4. Pull correctly run orderly bundles from `analysis/data/derived_data` into `global-lmic-reports-orderly`
5. Compile `gh-pages` and push to `mrc-ide/global-lmic-reports`

---

The rationale for separating these steps between the two repositories is to ensure that the `global-lmic-reports-orderly`
location is not on the network share, which has file backups set that can cause issues with file locking etc related to the 
orderly database. In addition, the use of `didehpc` (currently) requires the working directory when submitting jobs to be 
on the network share and so this separation currently seems the best approach.

#### 1. LaTeX and PDF Compile Issues
  
PDF compilation was initially tricky with the default setup not having pandoc on a network share nor being able to correctly compile the PDF document from orderly runs. As a result, both [TinyTex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) and pandoc were installed onto the network share at `L:/OJ` (pandoc was then copied over to its location on the network share):

```
tinytex::install_tinytex(dir = "L:/OJ/TinyTex")
installr::install.pandoc()
```

In the `global-lmic-reports-orderly` `lmic_reports_vaccine` run script, we then had to specify the following to get Rmd to compile PDF documents correctly.  

```
# pandoc linking
if (file.exists("L:\\OJ\\pandoc")) {
  rmarkdown:::set_pandoc_info("L:\\OJ\\pandoc")
  Sys.setenv(RSTUDIO_PANDOC="L:\\OJ\\pandoc")
  tinytex::use_tinytex("L:\\OJ\\TinyTex")
}

```

#### 6. Reconcile Errors

```{r}
dat <- obj$client$status_user("*", obj$config$cluster)
dat[vapply(grp$ids, grep, numeric(1), dat$name),]
```

## The R package 

This repository is organized as an R package. There are a few R functions exported in this package - the majority of the R code is in the analysis directory. The R package structure is here to help manage dependencies, to take advantage of continuous integration, and so we can keep file and data management simple.

To download the package source as you see it on GitHub, for offline browsing, use this line at the shell prompt (assuming you have Git installed on your computer):

```{r eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/mrc-ide/glodide.git
```

Once the download is complete, open the `glodide.Rproj` in RStudio to begin working with the package and compendium files. We will endeavor to keep all package dependencies required listed in the DESCRIPTION. This has the advantage of allowing `devtools::install_dev_deps()` to install the required R packages needed to run the code in this repository
